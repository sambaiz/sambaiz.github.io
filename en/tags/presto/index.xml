      <description>Redshift Serverless and other serverless aggregation services, run query with Glue Data Catalog - sambaiz-net
Compare the performance between Redshift Serverless and Athena by queries of TPC-DS, which is a database benchmark.
Generate data with TPC-DS Connector for Glue - sambaiz-net
First, execute the following query to the json and parquet data.
select /* TPC-DS query96.tpl 0.1 */ count(*) from store_sales ,household_demographics ,time_dim, store where ss_sold_time_sk = time_dim.t_time_sk and ss_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.</description>

      <description>Redshift Serverless Redshift Serverless is a new feature which can use Redshift, a petabyte-scale DWH without the instance, announced at this year&amp;rsquo;s re:Invent. It is available existing features such as Redshift Spectrum, refer to S3 directly, Federated Query to RDS, and Redshift ML. I&amp;rsquo;m happy with this update as it is costly to keep the instance running for occasional usage such as analytics.
The cost is charged for at least 1 minute RPU time and storage.</description>
