      <description>When you need to pass values that can be obtained only after createing resources in CDK, you may want to call Describe API. Normally, to do someting like this that is not managed by CloudFormation, you need to prepare your own lambda function and create a CustomResource, but if you just want to call AWS APIs, you can use AwsCustomResource.&#xA;import * as cdk from &amp;#39;aws-cdk-lib&amp;#39;; import { Construct } from &amp;#39;constructs&amp;#39;; import * as ec2 from &amp;#39;aws-cdk-lib/aws-ec2&amp;#39;; import * as eks from &amp;#39;aws-cdk-lib/aws-eks&amp;#39;; import { KubectlV27Layer } from &amp;#39;@aws-cdk/lambda-layer-kubectl-v27&amp;#39;; export class CdkCallAwsApiTestStack extends cdk.</description>

      <description>There are security groups and network ACLs settings to allow or deny traffic within the VPC. In security groups, responses to requests allowed inbound are allowed regardless of the outbound settings, but network ACLs are stateless for each request and response.&#xA;Once traffic is denied by these settings, the action field in VPC Flow Logs becomes REJECT, so if you output it to CloudWatch Logs, you can see the number of rejections of specific enis for each src/dst by executing the following query with Insights.</description>

      <description>EMR and Glue are managed services that run Spark applications on AWS. Glue is easy to run ETL jobs with serverless, while EMR allows fine-tuning of resources and parameters. In other words, if the settings are not appropriate, the resources cannot be fully used, and tasks can fail due to OOM even if there is excess memory.&#xA;In the CLI, settings can be passed as json string or a file with &amp;ndash;configurations.</description>

      <description>When investigating an application running in a remote non-container environment, sshd is often running, so commands can be executed with SSH connection. On the other hand, sshd isn&amp;rsquo;t usually running in a container environment, so it can&amp;rsquo;t be executed similarly. If absolutely necessary, there is a way to run sshd, but it would be better to avoid it in terms of opening ports and managing keys. In this article, command</description>

      <description>Amazon EMR is the service that launches a cluster installed Spark, Hive, and Presto on EC2 or EKS. While Glue, the managed Spark service, can easily run Spark ETL jobs with serverless, EMR has the advantage of excellent cost performance by spot instances etc., and also fine-tuning is available, but now that EMR Serverless has been released, the difference has narrowed a little. Glue also has handy features such as</description>

      <description>Theare are two methods to send Lambda logs to New Relic. First is a conventional method that uses a Lambda function aws-log-ingestion to subscribe and transfer CloudWatch Logs, and second is a method that uses a Lambda layer newrelic-lambda-extension. The latter send trace logs etc. without outputting to CloudWatch Logs so it can minimize the cost.

      <description>New Relic is a SaaS that monitors infrastructure and applications, and there is Datadog as a similar service. It seems that the pricing plans were changed drastically in 2020, and it charges according to the transfer volume and the number of admin users. Therefore compared to Datadog, which charges for hosts and additional features, there is an advantage when managing a large number of instances with a small number of</description>

If queries are executed ad-hoc, Presto-based Athena, which can quickly and easily query to tables in Glue&amp;rsquo;s data catalog, is handy, while if heavy queries are executed in batch, Spark-based Glue, which can avoid resource and time limitation, can be better.
