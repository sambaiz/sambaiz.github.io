      <description>Visualize Billing metrics There are Billing metrics in CloudWatch, so if you are sending all metrics in us-east-1 with Cloud Metric Streams, you can refer them with a query as follows.
SELECT max(`aws.billing.EstimatedCharges`) - min(`aws.billing.EstimatedCharges`) as daily_usage FROM Metric WHERE aws.Namespace = &amp;#39;AWS/Billing&amp;#39; AND `metricName` = &amp;#39;aws.billing.EstimatedCharges&amp;#39; AND `aws.billing.ServiceName` IS NOT NULL FACET monthOf(`timestamp`), `aws.billing.ServiceName` TIMESERIES 2 day SLIDE BY 1 day SINCE 4 week ago The values are accumulated monthly, so daily costs can be shown with taking differences from previous day&amp;rsquo;s one with Sliding window.</description>

      <description>If Spark jobs run on Cluster mode, the logs are not outputted to step/ directory, so it is hard to check it on the console, so try aggregating them to New Relic.
Launch an EMR cluster with AWS CLI and run Spark applications - sambaiz-net
Monitor infrastructure and applications with New Relic - sambaiz-net
Option 1. Sending logs with self installed fluent bit Install Fluent Bit that is memory saving fluentd, and send logs with it.</description>

      <description>New Relic categorizes telemetry data into Metrics, Events, Logs and Traces, called MELT. Sent data can be queried in NRQL, standard SQL-like queries, shown on a dashboard, and targeted as alert conditions, but sometimes desired value can&amp;rsquo;t be obtained depending on the data type. Metrics Periodically aggregated and sent data. Having aggregated data, the transfer cost can be reduced and track the long-term trend, but there is a trade-off that</description>
