      <description>YARN&amp;rsquo;s ResourceManager consists of ApplicationsManager, which receives applications from clients and launches ApplicationMaster, and Scheduler, which receives requests from ApplicationMaster and allocates resources.
How Hadoop YARN allocates resources to applications and check how much resources are allocated - sambaiz-net
Scheduler Scheduler has implementations such as CapacityScheduler, which aims to maximize the throughput in multi-tenant clusters, and FairScheduler, which allocates fair resources to all applications. You can choose to use which one with yarn.</description>

      <description>Maximum flow problem Maximum flow promlem is a problem that maximizes the flow from the source to the sink in the network consisting of paths with capacity. It is necessary not to exceed the capacity and to equal input and output amount for each node. Besides, all of the data emitted from the source must be sent to the sink. Minimum cut problem Minimum cut problem is a problem that</description>

      <description>Segment Tree Segment Tree is a complete binary tree which can calculate partial sum at O(log n) by having the calculation results in each partials as node. In the following example, the calculated value is sum, but if it is the minimum value, Range Minimum Query (RMQ) can be solved and if it is the sorted list, merge sort is processed. When updating the value, recalculate in order from the</description>

      <description>Union-Find Tree Union-Find Tree is a data structure having some disjoint sets and can do &amp;ldquo;Union&amp;rdquo; which merges two sets, and &amp;ldquo;Find&amp;rdquo; which checks if two elements are in the same set with amortized O(α(n)) (α(n) is an inverse Ackermann function and smaller than log(n)). &amp;ldquo;Union&amp;rdquo; connects the tree with the smaller rank to under side so that merged tree</description>

      <title>Implement Rabin–Karp algorithm in C&#43;&#43;</title>

      <description>Rabin–Karp algorithm is a string-searching algorithm using rolling hash. Rolling hash can be made with O(1) by removing a first element from the previous hash and adding a next element to it. There are various hash functions which can do it, but for example, when simply summing up character codes, the hashes will collide just because the same character is contained,</description>
