      <title>How faster is sending/receiving values by UNIX domain socket than starting new processes when executing commands</title>

      <description>For example when some procedures are written in different languages and they are repeatedly executed as different commands, overhead such as memory allocation occurs when creating a process. One of solutions to avoid this is to keep the process running and pass input/output value with interprocess communication. In this article I make a command in Go and benchmark to see how much the throughput differs.
For speedy interprocess communication on UNIX, besides shared memory, pipes and UNIX domain sockets are used.</description>
