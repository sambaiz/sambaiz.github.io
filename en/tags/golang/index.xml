      <description>JNI (Java Native Interface) is an interface to enable Java to call native codes in C/C++ executed outside JVM and enable native codes to call codes in Java. This makes it possible to speed up heavy processing and share processing across multiple platforms. JNA (Java Native Access), a library, is also available to call native codes from Java, and it is easier to use and makes effort to minimize the</description>

      <description>deanishe/awgo is a library to implement scripts running in Alfred Workflows. It enables to output Script Filter JSON to pass values to the next object with NewItem(), access keychain, and check logs with MagicAction by calling wf.Args() and passing workflow:log as arguments. The code is executed every time a character is typed by default, so it would be better to cache results of API calls, etc. as follows. There are</description>

      <description>Pushing the button, the function implemented in Go is called, and it updates the value of text.
$ go version go version go1.18 darwin/amd64 Go can refer variables and call functions in js with syscall/js package. By breaking changes of Go 1.12, NewCallback() is renamed to FuncOf(). The function must return the value that has a type js.ValueOf() expects, so if returns a struct, an error occurs.

      <title>How faster is sending/receiving values by UNIX domain socket than starting new processes when executing commands</title>

      <description>For example when some procedures are written in different languages and they are repeatedly executed as different commands, overhead such as memory allocation occurs when creating a process. One of solutions to avoid this is to keep the process running and pass input/output value with interprocess communication. In this article I make a command in Go and benchmark to see how much the throughput differs.
For speedy interprocess communication on UNIX, besides shared memory, pipes and UNIX domain sockets are used.</description>

      <description>New Relic is a SaaS that monitors infrastructure and applications, and there is Datadog as a similar service. It seems that the pricing plans were changed drastically in 2020, and it charges according to the transfer volume and the number of admin users. Therefore compared to Datadog, which charges for hosts and additional features, there is an advantage when managing a large number of instances with a small number of</description>
