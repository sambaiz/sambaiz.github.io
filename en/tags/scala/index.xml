      <description>Spark provides Java and Python APIs in addition to Scala, which is used for developing Spark itself. You can choose among them depending on the technical stack and technologies used in other components, etc.
While Python is highly compatible with data analysis and machine learning skill sets, it needs to be converted with Py4J, so it has disadvantage in terms of the performance.
Scala tends to be said it is relatively hard, but it&amp;rsquo;s not much different from PySpark in terms of calling Spark API.</description>
