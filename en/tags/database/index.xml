      <description>Redshift Serverless and other serverless aggregation services, run query with Glue Data Catalog - sambaiz-net&#xA;Compare the performance between Redshift Serverless (Preview) and Athena by queries of TPC-DS, which is a database benchmark.&#xA;(PS: 2022-07-13) Following values were calculated at the rate at the time of preview. When it became GA, the rate dropped by about 30%.&#xA;Generate data with TPC-DS Connector for Glue - sambaiz-net&#xA;First, executed the following query to the json and parquet data.</description>

      <description>Previously, I tried to generate 250GB of data with Athena&amp;rsquo;s TPC-DS Connector and output it to S3 but it timed out even if I increased the Lambda resource to the maximum, so I do it with Glue this time.&#xA;Generate data with TPC-DS Connector in Athena&amp;rsquo;s Federated Query - sambaiz-net&#xA;Subscribe and activate TPC-DS connector for Glue.&#xA;Write a script like following. The scale is in GB, the same as Athena&amp;rsquo;s one.</description>

      <description>Athena&amp;rsquo;s Federated Query is a feature to execute queries on non-S3 data sources such as DynamoDB and RDS through Lambda function which is a data sources connector. Implement Athena&amp;rsquo;s data source connectors and user defined functions (UDF) - sambaiz-net This article uses TPC-DS Connector in the AWS official repository. It generates the data of TPC-DS, which is a database benchmark in Decision Support. Although it is in the official repository,</description>
