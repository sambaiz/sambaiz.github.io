      <description>Amazon EMR is the service that launches a cluster installed Spark, Hive, and Presto on EC2 or EKS. While Glue, the managed Spark service, can easily run Spark ETL jobs with serverless, EMR has the advantage of excellent cost performance by spot instances etc., and also fine-tuning is available, but now that EMR Serverless has been released, the difference has narrowed a little. Glue also has handy features such as</description>

      <description>Redshift Serverless Redshift Serverless is a new feature that can use Redshift, a petabyte-scale DWH without launching an instance, announced at this year&amp;rsquo;s re:Invent. It is available existing features such as Redshift Spectrum, refer to S3 directly, Federated Query to RDS, and Redshift ML. I&amp;rsquo;m happy with this update as it is costly to keep the instance running for occasional usage such as analytics. The cost is charged for at</description>

      <description>When you read data without specifying schema in Spark, the schema is automatically determined from the input as follows. # {&amp;#34;aaa&amp;#34;:123,&amp;#34;ccc&amp;#34;:[123],&amp;#34;eee&amp;#34;:{&amp;#34;fff&amp;#34;:123},&amp;#34;hhh&amp;#34;:null} df = spark.read.json(&amp;#34;s3://hogefuga/testjson/&amp;#34;) df.printSchema() &amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39; root |-- aaa: long (nullable = true) |-- ccc: array (nullable = true) | |-- element: long (containsNull = true) |-- eee: struct (nullable = true) | |-- fff: long (nullable = true) |-- hhh: string (nullable = true) &amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39; This works well in</description>

      <description>Spark Web UI is a tool for monitoring Jobs and Executors. Get Dockerfile that runs Spark based on maven: 3.6-amazoncorretto-8 from aws-glue-samples, and start History Server with the path of EventLog output by Glue and authentication information to get it. $ git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-glue-samples.git $ cd aws-glue-samples/utilities/Spark_UI/glue-3_0/ $ docker build -t glue/sparkui:latest . $ docker run -it -e SPARK_HISTORY_OPTS=&amp;#34;$SPARK_HISTORY_OPTS-Dspark.history.fs.logDirectory=s3a://path_to_eventlog -Dspark.hadoop.fs.s3a.access.key=$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID-Dspark.hadoop.fs.s3a.secret.key=$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY&amp;#34; -p 18080:18080 glue/sparkui:latest &amp;#34;/opt/spark/bin/spark-class org.apache.spark.deploy.history.HistoryServer&amp;#34; Now, you can access http://localhost:18080</description>

      <title>Athena (Presto) and Glue (Spark) can return different values when running the same query</title>

      <description>AWS has multiple managed services that aggregate with SQL-like queries. If queries are executed ad-hoc, Presto-based Athena, which can quickly and easily query to tables in Glue&amp;rsquo;s data catalog, is handy, while if heavy queries are executed in batch, Spark-based Glue, which can avoid resource and time limitation, can be better. Therefore, they can be used properly depending on the case.

      <description>What is Spark? Spark is high-performance general-purpose distributed processing system. It is used with distributed storage such as HDFS and S3, and cluster managers such as Hadoop YARN. It can be processed faster than Hadoop&amp;rsquo;s MapReduce by storing the intermediate data in memory. There are APIs for Java, Scala, Python, R. While python is easy to write, performance suffers due to interaction with JVM. HDFS(Hadoop Distributed File Sys</description>

      <description>What is Hive Hive is a data warehouse software built on Hadoop, which can access data sources such as HDFS with HiveSQL, an extended SQL. Sending a query, the job runs on MapReduce, Spark or Tez. It has fault tolerance and is mainly used in batch processing. What is HDFS(Hadoop Distributed File System) - sambaiz-net Presto, which access data sources with SQL likewise, can execute the query faster than Hive</description>
