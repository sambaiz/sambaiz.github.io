      <title>IP address exhaustion with EKS cluster and migration to IPv6</title>

      <description>When I ran a large application on an EKS cluster, the subnet&amp;rsquo;s IP addresses ran out. Reason for IP address exhaustion Pod IP addresses are assigned by ipamd (IP Address Management Daemon) of VPC CNI, and these are from the instance&amp;rsquo;s secondary IP addresses. The number of secondary IP addresses are controlled with WARM_ENI_TARGET (Default: 1), which is the number of spare ENIs, or WARM_IP_TARGET (Default: None), which is the</description>

      <title>Setting security groups for EKS cluster&#39;s nodes created with CDK</title>

      <description>aws_eks.Cluster in CDK has a securityGroup field, but this is an SG associated with the ENI of the control plane, not the node. If it is not passed, it will be automatically created.&#xA;Then, where is the SG settings for EKS cluster&amp;rsquo;s nodes? It is in the node group&amp;rsquo;s auto scaling group.&#xA;When you create an EKS cluster with CDK and DefaultCapacityType is NODEGROUP, which is the default, manged node group is created, which consists of defaultCapacity nodes and EKS performs drain etc.</description>

      <description>Karpenter is an OSS that scales a Kubernetes cluster developed by AWS. Compared to Cluster Autoscaler, it can perform fast and flexible provisioning not through Auto Scaling Group. It supports only EKS so far, but it seems to have possibility to support other cloud providers.&#xA;(PS: 2023-12-06) now available on AKS&#xA;In this article, I install Karpenter on an EKS cluster with CDK, and confirm the cluster to be auto-scaled when the number of replicas is changed.</description>

      <description>EMR on EKS is a feature to run Spark on EKS. While normal EMR also manages Hadoop clusters, EMR on EKS is only responsible for starting containers. Launch an EMR cluster with AWS CLI and run Spark applications - sambaiz-net By running on Kubernetes, you can use tools and functions for Kubernetes to manage and monitor, and utilize resources left over if you have an existing cluster. It also enables</description>
