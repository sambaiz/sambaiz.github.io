      <description>Theare are two methods to send Lambda logs to New Relic. First is a conventional method that uses a Lambda function aws-log-ingestion to subscribe and transfer CloudWatch Logs, and second is a method that uses a Lambda layer newrelic-lambda-extension. The latter send trace logs etc. without outputting to CloudWatch Logs so it can minimize the cost.

      <description>New Relic is a SaaS that monitors infrastructure and applications, and there is Datadog as a similar service. It seems that the pricing plans were changed drastically in 2020, and it charges according to the transfer volume and the number of admin users. Therefore compared to Datadog, which charges for hosts and additional features, there is an advantage when managing a large number of instances with a small number of people.</description>
